# DATA515-Image-Classification


## The Project Type:
Web-based tool

## Questions of Interest: 
* How accurately can we classify images into predefined animal categories?
* Can we distinguish between similar-appearing animals (e.g. same species)?
* Can we identify animals through different environments and lighting conditions?
* Can we identify animals if given a low-quality image input?
* Can we identify animals that we have not trained our model upon?

## Goal for project output: 
Create an image classification tool that can correctly identify animals if given an image

## Data Sources: 
* Use of observational data provided from [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/about) 
  * More than 1 Million research-grade observational photos
  * Easily can filter and download sets of data or use their API
* Labeled animal image dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals)
  * More than 5,000 images
  * 90 different animal types
* Database of animal facts from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-information-dataset) 
  * Generate facts to correspond with user input
