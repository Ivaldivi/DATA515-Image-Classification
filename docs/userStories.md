# USER STORIES 

## USER 1: Tourist- Bob 
Bob is a tourist in the state of Washington, who is seeing a lot of cool buildings, and does not know how to easily look up the landmarks he's seeing. He will take pictures of the landmarks he is curious about and upload them to the web app. He needs an easy to use user interface, and easily understandable output from the website- that does not assume he is an expert on architecture or local lore. He needs to be able to take pictures, upload them, have access to wi-fi, and ability to use the internet. 


## USER 2: Architect- Doug (Annie's Dad)
Doug is an architect visiting Seattle for the first time. He wants to figure out the name and architect of the buildings and landmarks he sees. He needs to be able to upload photos, have access to wi-fi, and know how to use the internet. As an architect, he wants to be able to learn the name of the landmark as well as where to learn more about its history. 

## TECHNICIAN 1: ML model maintainer
The technician will be maintaining the image classification model. They need the ability to update the data, fine tune the model, and retrain the model with any new data. They would have to monitor user requests for new landmarks, and feedback from incorrect model output. They need access to the existing requirements.txt file, and update it as any new requirements arise.
